This repository contains two codes to reproduce parts A and B of the figure in ``The NP-hardness of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance" by N. Kravtsova. 

Part A uses spaces contructed in Exmple 5.2 of this reference (no additional files are  needed when using the code):
Facundo Memoli. Gromov–Wasserstein distances and the metric approach to object matching. Foundations of computational mathematics, 11:417–487, 2011.
https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~saito/data/acha.read.w12/memoli-gromov-dist.pdf

Part B requires two data files - Lotka1.dat and Lotka2.dat. These data is constructed by simulating the model from this reference:
Dongmei Xiao and Wenxia Li. Limit cycles for the competitive three dimensional Lotka–Volterra system. Journal of Differential Equations, 164(1):1–15, 2000

The details on simulating this model are given in Section 3.1 and Figure 3 of this reference:
